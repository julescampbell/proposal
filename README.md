# Pre-Proposal
## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. Create the framework for a game and have ChatGPT design a random storyline, characters, graphics, and plot twists to generate a new feeling game every time you play.
2. Set up an algorithm to produce real looking social media posts in the form of text or photos. Have the algorithm run on actual accounts and following slightly different scripts to try to see what causes posts to gain attention.
3. Create a smaller but still functional version of the stock market that changes in real time. The changes will be similar to real life company prices but will not follow any one stock exactly. Add a currency to trade with to turn it into a kind of game or trading simulator.
4. A game launcher with multiple minigames that incorperate different areas of python and ChatGPT.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Most likely working alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Which idea do you like the most?




# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

AI RPG / AI Stock Market Sim

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Randomly generated storyline, characters, graphics, and plot twists to make a new feeling game every time you play.
or
Simulated stock market tool that offers the user news headlines that coorelate to the changes in stock prices.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will create the framework for a game and have ChatGPT design a random storyline, characters, graphics, and plot twists to generate a new story as you play.
or
The user will have a starting sum of money and has to buy and sell simulated stocks. There will be AI generated fake news headlines for the game's companies that will coorelate to the actual change in the company's price.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will have at the very least, some type of interactable software that impliments the power of OpenAI within the Python code.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will hopefully learn a way to generate AI art for free with Python, but if I am not able to I may work around this by randomly selecting from a set of presaved AI images instead.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for me is to be able to complete both of these projects before the due date because I think that once I completely understand one of them I will be able to make the other much faster.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I am currently reaserching a way to generate AI art within the Python script. I have already learned how to prompt ChatGPT and edit the responses within my program, which was a big step towards my goal, so now I am doing more research on AI art and game libraries for Python while I decide where to start.
