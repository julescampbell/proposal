# Pre-Proposal
## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. Create the framework for a game and have ChatGPT design a random storyline, characters, graphics, and plot twists to generate a new feeling game every time you play.
2. Set up an algorithm to produce real looking social media posts in the form of text or photos. Have the algorithm run on actual accounts and following slightly different scripts to try to see what causes posts to gain attention.
3. Create a smaller but still functional version of the stock market that changes in real time. The changes will be similar to real life company prices but will not follow any one stock exactly. Add a currency to trade with to turn it into a kind of game or trading simulator.
4. A game launcher with multiple minigames that incorperate different areas of python and ChatGPT.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Most likely working alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Which idea do you like the most?


### Update - I am leaning towards doing the stock market simulator.
